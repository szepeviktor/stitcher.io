- If it's not your passion, don't expect it to last long
- Don't bother with a consistent posting schedule, it'll burn you out and decrease the quality of your posts
- Don't bother writing for the sake of writing: it produces crap content â€” I've tried it, it's not worth it
- Only write when you want to. This resulted in sometimes two or three posts a week, sometimes none for a month
- Research the topic: with online sources and by talking about them to a friend
- Styling should put content first, nothing above that. Let the text speak for itself, and only add your own subtle personal touch
- Don't think of blogposts as separate entities. They are a collection of knowledge and tell a bigger story. Connect them by inner linking

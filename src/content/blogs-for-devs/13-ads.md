### Ads

- Ads are probably the worst way to monitize your blog
- They are also the simplest way to set up
- Ad revenue will highly depend on the niche and target audience
- If you're a technical blogger your target audience will have a higher rate of ad blockers
- If you decide to go with ads, look for ads that provide at least some value, eg. Carbon ads
- Don't overdo it. Remember: content is king, ads shouldn't be intrusive

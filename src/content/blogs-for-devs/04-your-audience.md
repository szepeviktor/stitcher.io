- Know who your audience is and where to reach them
- Don't _only_ write for one group: try out different things to expand, but don't overdo it
- Eg: write about a programming language, also write about programming in general. If you want to also write about a hobby of yours, feel free to manage it on the same blog, but on a separate feed 
- You might need to shift your focus along the way to other kinds of topics within the same niche. Be careful that you're still happy writing about them

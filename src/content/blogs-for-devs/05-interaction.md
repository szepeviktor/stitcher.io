- Interact with your audience, let them know you're more than a bunch of blog posts somewhere on the internet
- Engaging with your audience through different channels of social media takes as much time, if not more, as writing content. This is part of the job.
- Don't use social media to only promote your content, share other people's content, get truly involved.
- Being involved also means you'll have to challenge yourself to read more other sources. This can be an inspiration, but also confront you with things you might not have done very well. It's a great learning experience
- Channels like Twitter, Facebook Groups, Reddit, HackerNode, Hashnode, Dev.to, Medium, some community-specific aggregation sites
- Sidenote: some of these channels like Medium or Hashnode require you to cross post your content, we'll cover the technicalities later

- The internet is a place of fast consumption
- No one will return or even remember your blog after they've read one post. Even if they found it great
- Offer them ways to stay in touch: via mail, RSS or by following you on social media
- You can start with the free mailchimp plan, but be prepared to either pay or look for cheaper solutions (I use mailcoach)
- Don't spam your users. Remember that content is king. So no popups, overlays or whatever. Maybe a subtle call to action once or AT MAX twice throughout the post. The ones who are genuinely interested and want to stay up to date will see them. There's no need in gathering twice as many email addresses, if only a quarter of people will actually open your mails or visit you links.
